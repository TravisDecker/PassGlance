# PassGlance
PassGlance is a simple command line program that scans a given word list for a given word.
It is designed to find passwords and variations on a given password in a word list and return a count.

The PassGlance class file contains a bash script allowing you to simply call bash fallowed by the program. 
This was done to make PassGlance more user friendly and more like other command line programs.
